# Instagram of the Night

All fans in attendance at the Trail Blazers home games had an opportunity to be featured as the Instagram post of the night. The process was simple: share a photo somewhere at the arena during the game and use that game's specific hashtag. My role was to select the winner, craft post copy and share on @[trailblazers][0]. ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/6b1eb316-6013-4249-be71-51dc6cde62a0.png)
